(Non-)Competitive programming olympiad questions I have done

Obviously, people do competitive programming to compete against others. Of course, as a person who has **surpassed** programming, I have no need to be **competitive** anymore, and I only do these for **fun**.

Jokes aside, these are just competitive programming olympiad questions I have solved, whether they be in the official olympiad, or as a past paper question.
